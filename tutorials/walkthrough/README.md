# MCP Request Flow Walkthrough

A journey-shaped tour of what actually happens when an MCP client and server talk to each other — wire bytes, dispatch, the bidirectional contract, transport variations, and how all of it composes.

Complementary to the [official MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18). The spec is reference-shaped (feature-by-feature, normative shapes); this walkthrough is journey-shaped (follow a request, see every layer it touches, in the order it touches them).

This is a **working document, built incrementally and conversationally** — one question at a time. New pages get added as the discussion reaches them.

## Where to start

Each **root** is a self-contained chunk: read its preconditions, walk through it, end with a known set of invariants. Pick the ones you care about — you don't have to read them all.

Recommended reading order for someone new to the material:

1. **[Bring-up: from host to live session](./bringup.md)** — *root, foundational*  
   Server selection, transport selection, connection establishment, auth, the `initialize` handshake, capability negotiation. *End-state: a session is live, transport is chosen, auth is resolved, protocol version + capabilities are locked.*

2. **[Transport mechanics: stdio vs. streamable HTTP](./transport-mechanics.md)** — *root, foundational*  
   What the wire actually looks like per transport. The SSE "upgrade" demystified, the standing-GET back-channel, JSON-RPC correlation, per-direction ID spaces, the reverse-call origination constraint. *End-state: you can read messages off the wire on either transport and follow the correlation model.*

3. **[Notifications](./notifications.md)** — *root · FAQ-style*  
   The session's state-change channel, in five questions: taxonomy + capability gating, the list-changed worked example, cancellation against the pending-id table, progress pairing via `_meta.progressToken`, and what receivers do with unknown notifications. *End-state: you know all six notification families, their direction, what gates each, and how progress and cancellation interact with session state.*

4. **[Per-request anatomy](./request-anatomy.md)** — *root · FAQ-style*  
   How a single MCP request travels from caller through middleware, dispatch, handler context, the handler itself, and back. Five questions: end-to-end walkthrough of `tools/call`, what's in the handler context, how the four middleware stacks compose, how typed binding works, how the same path serves notifications and reverse calls. *End-state: you can trace any request through all 13 steps, know what handlers receive, and know how the same machinery handles requests / notifications / reverse calls.*

5. **[Extension mechanisms](./extension-mechanisms.md)** — *root · FAQ-style*  
   How MCP grows. Six questions: the four extension surfaces (method namespace, capability flags, notifications, `_meta`), the SEP process and `experimental.` namespace, mcpkit's three-tier code organization (`core/` → `ext/` → `experimental/ext/`), the mcpkit extension points you write against (registries, middleware, custom transports), case studies (tasks, auth, apps, events, list-TTL, MRTR, elicitation), and the boundary between protocol extension and host/client policy. *End-state: you can read "this extension uses SEP-X" or "this is a `_meta`-only extension" and know what it means.*

6. **[Events](./events.md)** — *root · FAQ-style*  
   Events as a first-class extension, beyond the raw SSE-event-id replay streamable HTTP gives you for free. Seven questions: how events dial all four extension knobs (and how events differ from notifications), the three delivery modes (poll, push, webhook) and when to pick each, canonical-tuple subscription identity, the `YieldingSource` / `TypedSource` abstractions, push delivery on the wire (`events/stream` → SSE with five notification frames), webhook delivery (Standard Webhooks HMAC + the hardened delivery loop with SSRF guard / suspend / control envelopes / `deliveryStatus`), and source health signals (`YieldError` transient vs `YieldTerminated` terminal). *End-state: you can read code in `experimental/ext/events/` and recognize each piece's role; you can pick a delivery mode for a new source; you understand why subscription identity is a tuple, not a server-issued id.*

7. **[MRTR — Multi Round-Trip Requests](./mrtr.md)** — *root · FAQ-style · SEP-2322*  
   How a `tools/call` pauses for input *without* holding the call open. Six questions: what problem MRTR solves that reverse calls don't, a worked deploy-tool example with two-round wire trace, server-side `ctx.RequestInput()` and the `IsInputRequired` dispatch reshape, client-side `CallToolWithInputs` + `DefaultInputHandler`'s bridge to existing sampling/elicitation/roots handlers, `requestState` signing (HMAC, TTL, tool-name pinning), and composition with tasks v2 which reuses the same `InputRequiredResult` envelope. *End-state: you can return `InputRequiredResult` from a handler, run the client-side retry loop, and reason about the signed-token round handle.*

8. **[Reverse-call mechanics](./reverse-call.md)** — *root · FAQ-style*  
   How a server handler synchronously asks the client for sampling, elicitation, or filesystem roots — and what dies when. Six questions: what a reverse call is and why exist, a `tools/call → elicitation/create` worked example showing two ids on the wire as one logical operation, server-side `bc.Sample`/`bc.Elicit` originating via the `sessionCtx.request` hook, client-side `HandleServerRequestWithContext` as the canonical dispatcher (and how MRTR reuses it), the asymmetry that makes **roots infrastructure-managed** rather than handler-originated, and the lifetime trap (handler context dies with the forward request) plus `core.DetachForBackground` as the supported escape. *End-state: you can originate any of the three reverse-call methods, understand capability gating, and not be surprised when `context.WithoutCancel` doesn't keep your background goroutine working.*

*(More pages get appended here as the conversation reaches them — tasks, auth deep-dive, apps, …)*

## Other entry points

- **[STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md)** — how this walkthrough is organized: the DAG model, the four-part page contract (Prerequisites / Body / End-state / Next to read), conventions for note blocks, branch points, spec/code anchors, target-shape tracking. Read this if you want to understand *why* pages look the way they do, or if you plan to author one.
- **[INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)** — single-page projection of the whole graph. Every page, its preconditions, end-state, successor pointers, and mid-journey branch points — in one table, with a full mermaid render. Read this to see the shape of what's covered (and what's planned) without opening individual files.
