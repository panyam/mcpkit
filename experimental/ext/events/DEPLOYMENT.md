# Deployment Notes — `experimental/ext/events`

Operational guidance for running an MCP Events server with webhook delivery in private-cloud environments. Focused on the questions that come up when production WAFs and firewall teams get involved.

This is a living document — the events extension itself is experimental, and so are some of the deployment patterns. Where mcpkit ships partial implementation (e.g., `ValidateWebhookURL`'s loopback handling), this doc calls out what to add for production.

## Direction of traffic

Webhook delivery is **server → client**. The MCP server (your `events.WebhookRegistry`) is the HTTP *client*; the receiver URL is the HTTP *server*.

```

Implications for firewalls:

- The MCP server needs **outbound** internet egress to reach receiver URLs. No inbound webhook traffic to the MCP server itself.
- The receiver lives **inside the customer's network**, behind their WAF. The WAF must allow the MCP server's source IPs to reach it.
- Subscribers (browsers, agents, etc.) connect to the MCP server over MCP's normal Streamable HTTP transport — that's a separate flow.

## What to put in your WAF

For deployments where the receiver sits behind a WAF, the rules need to allow webhook deliveries through. Recommended allowlist:

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Method** | `POST` | All deliveries are POSTs |
| **Path** | Whatever the subscriber registered (`callback_url`) | The MCP server POSTs to exactly this URL |
| **Source IP** | The MCP server's egress IPs | Restrict to known issuers |
| **Headers required** | `Content-Type: application/json` + the signature pair (see below) | Reject unsigned requests at the edge |
| **Headers (StandardWebhooks mode, default)** | `webhook-id` + `webhook-timestamp` + `webhook-signature` (`v1,<base64>`) | Per [standardwebhooks.com](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/) |
| **Headers (MCPHeaders mode, opt-in)** | `X-MCP-Signature` (`sha256=<hex>`) + `X-MCP-Timestamp` (unix seconds) | The pre-r3167245184 default; opt-in for callers that already wired against this shape |
| **Body size** | Reasonable cap (1 MB is plenty for almost any event payload) | Limit DoS surface |
| **Rate limit** | Per source IP, generous (≥ 100 r/s) | Bursts happen during reconnects + identity-mode rebroadcasts |

Don't reject based on User-Agent — mcpkit uses Go's default `net/http` UA which can change between versions.

## SSRF guards (server side)

`events.ValidateWebhookURL` runs at `events/subscribe` time and rejects obviously bad callback URLs. Today it checks:

- Scheme is `http` or `https`.
- **Warns** (does not reject) on `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `0.0.0.0` — useful for dev/test.

For production, **add DNS resolution + private-IP rejection**:

- Resolve the URL's hostname to A/AAAA records at subscribe time.
- Reject if any resolved address falls in RFC 1918 private space (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), link-local (`169.254/16`), or IPv6 ULA (`fc00::/7`).
- Re-resolve on each delivery if you're paranoid about DNS rebinding (mcpkit's default `http.Client` does not do this).

The cheapest place to add this is by wrapping `ValidateWebhookURL` and configuring your own validator on the registry, or by patching the existing function for your fork. Until the spec settles, it's an operator responsibility.

## Retry and backoff timing

The default `WebhookRegistry.deliver` policy (in `webhook.go`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| HTTP client timeout | 5 seconds per attempt |
| Initial backoff | 500 ms |
| Backoff growth | 2x per retry |
| Max backoff | 5 seconds |
| Max retries | 3 (so up to 4 attempts total) |
| Retry on | Network errors, HTTP 5xx |
| Don't retry on | HTTP 4xx (treated as receiver-side reject) |

Worst-case wall clock for a fully-failing delivery: roughly `5s + 0.5s + 5s + 1s + 5s + 2s + 5s ≈ 23s` (timeouts + backoffs + retries). Tune your WAF / proxy idle timeouts so they don't kill the connection inside this window.

**Receiver implications:**

- Receivers should be **idempotent**. The same event may arrive more than once if the receiver returned a 5xx and the retry succeeded. Deduplicate by `event.eventId` (always present, always unique per source).
- Returning **HTTP 4xx** stops retries. Use 4xx for "I will never accept this" (bad signature, malformed payload). Use 5xx for "try again" (transient infrastructure issue).
- Returning **HTTP 2xx fast** matters more than the body — the body is ignored. A WAF that buffers responses can hold up the delivery loop briefly but won't cause re-delivery if the upstream returned 2xx.

## TTL refresh as keepalive

Webhook subscriptions are soft state. The default TTL is 60 seconds (`WithWebhookTTL` overrides). Subscribers MUST re-subscribe before the TTL expires or the registry evicts them and deliveries stop.

The shipped client SDKs handle this automatically:

- **Go** (`experimental/ext/events/clients/go`): `Subscription` runs a background loop that re-calls `events/subscribe` at `RefreshFactor × TTL` (default 0.5).
- **Python** (`experimental/ext/events/clients/python/events_client.py`): `WebhookSubscription` does the same.

Both helpers handle the boundary race: if a refresh hits the registry just after the TTL expired (subscription not found), they immediately re-subscribe and fire the `OnRecover` callback.

**Operational implications:**

- The refresh traffic is `events/subscribe` calls on the MCP wire, **not** webhook traffic. Stateful firewalls between the subscriber and the MCP server need to allow that.
- If the network between the subscriber and the MCP server flaps, the refresh won't land and the registry will GC the subscription. A new `events/subscribe` once connectivity returns is the recovery path; expect a small gap in deliveries.
- Sizing: 60 s default TTL × 0.5 refresh factor = one refresh call per subscription per 30 s. With 10K active subscriptions this is ~333 r/s of subscribe traffic — small but not zero.

## Webhook secret considerations

Per spec, the webhook signing secret is **client-supplied only** (`whsec_` + base64 of 24-64 random bytes per the Standard Webhooks profile). The server validates the format at `events/subscribe` time and stores the value as-is. The server does NOT generate or rotate secrets.

Operational notes:

- **Receiver and subscriber must agree on the secret.** If they're the same process (e.g., a forward proxy that subscribes on its own behalf), this is automatic. If they're different — e.g., proxy receives, app subscribes — the subscriber must communicate the secret to the proxy out-of-band. SDKs auto-generate by default; surface the value via your secrets-manager / proxy-config path.
- **Rotation is client-initiated.** Supply a new `whsec_` value on a refresh `events/subscribe` call. The server replaces the stored value; in-flight deliveries signed with the old secret will fail verification at the receiver. Spec describes a Standard-Webhooks dual-sign grace window for this case (not yet implemented in mcpkit; tracked under PR group ζ).
- **Treat each `whsec_` value as a credential.** Provision via secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, K8s secret with appropriate restrictions) when subscribing programmatically. Compromise of one secret only compromises that subscription's deliveries — there's no master root.

## Auth + tuple subscription identity (γ)

Per spec §"Subscription Identity" → "Authentication required" L361, webhook `events/subscribe` and `events/unsubscribe` MUST require an authenticated principal — servers reject unauthenticated calls with `-32012 Unauthorized`. The registry keys subscriptions on the canonical tuple `(principal, delivery.url, name, params)`; cross-tenant isolation is by construction since the principal is part of the key.

Production wiring (the spec-strict path):

```go
validator := auth.NewJWTValidator(auth.JWTConfig{
    JWKSURL:  "<your-OIDC-issuer>/.well-known/jwks.json",
    Issuer:   "<your-OIDC-issuer>",
    Audience: "mcp-events",
})
validator.Start()

srv := server.NewServer(
    core.ServerInfo{...},
    server.WithSubscriptions(),
    server.WithAuth(validator),  // ← anonymous webhook subscribes → -32012
)
events.Register(events.Config{
    Sources:  ...,
    Webhooks: webhooks,
    Server:   srv,
    // UnsafeAnonymousPrincipal intentionally NOT set — production
    // deployments rely on the spec-strict auth gate.
})
```

The `events` package only depends on `core.Claims` (the abstract auth contract), not on `ext/auth` or any specific auth implementation. You can swap in mTLS-derived principals, session-cookie validators, or custom JWKS — Events keeps working as long as `ctx.AuthClaims().Subject` returns the principal.

### `UnsafeAnonymousPrincipal` is for demos only

The `events.Config.UnsafeAnonymousPrincipal` field deliberately deviates from the spec — when set, anonymous calls are accepted under the configured principal. **Production deployments MUST leave this field empty.** The startup log line emitted by `events.Register` explicitly warns when it's non-empty so misconfiguration is loud rather than silent.

If a production deployment sets it: the spec's `-32012` rejection is bypassed; webhook subscribe accepts anonymous calls under a single shared principal; cross-tenant isolation breaks (everyone is "the demo user"); the audit trail loses its principal field. None of these are acceptable production properties.

The demos use it as an escape hatch so `make demo` works without standing up an auth provider. Each demo also auto-detects `OAUTH_ISSUER` and switches to real auth when present — see `examples/events/discord/README.md` for the env-var contract.

## Connecting an MCP host

Once the server is running, point any MCP host at it:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add events --transport streamable-http http://your-server/mcp

# Claude Desktop / VS Code (mcp.json)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "events": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://your-server/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For interactive demos, see the walkthroughs in [`examples/events/discord/`](../../../examples/events/discord/) and [`examples/events/telegram/`](../../../examples/events/telegram/).

## Quick checklist

Before going live with a webhook-enabled events server in a private-cloud deployment:

- [ ] Receiver behind WAF, allowlist rules in place (method/path/source-IP/headers).
- [ ] MCP server has outbound egress to receiver URLs.
- [ ] SSRF protection — DNS resolution + private-IP rejection wraps `ValidateWebhookURL`.
- [ ] WAF / proxy idle timeouts > 25 s to survive the worst-case retry chain.
- [ ] Receiver is idempotent on `event.eventId`.
- [ ] Receiver returns 2xx for accept, 4xx for reject-permanently, 5xx for retry.
- [ ] Webhook secrets (each subscription's `whsec_` value) reach the receiver via your secrets-management path; rotation procedure documented.
- [ ] **`events.Config.UnsafeAnonymousPrincipal` is EMPTY** in production code paths. Auth is wired via `server.WithAuth(...)`. Anonymous webhook subscribes return `-32012 Unauthorized`.
- [ ] Server startup log shows `[events] WARNING: UnsafeAnonymousPrincipal=...` is **NOT** present. (Its presence indicates the demo escape hatch is on.)
- [ ] If using Standard Webhooks header mode, WAF allowlist has the `webhook-*` headers (not `X-MCP-*`).
- [ ] Subscribers run an SDK that auto-refreshes (or have explicit refresh logic that fires before `refreshBefore`).
